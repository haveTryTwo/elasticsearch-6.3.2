 * This is a basic channel abstraction used by the {@link org.elasticsearch.transport.nio.NioTransport}.
 * <p>
 * A channel is open once it is constructed. The channel remains open and {@link #isOpen()} will return
 * true until the channel is explicitly closed.
 * <p>
 * A channel lifecycle has two stages:
 * <ol>
 * <li>OPEN - When a channel has been created. This is the state of a channel that can perform normal operations.
 * <li>CLOSED - The channel has been set to closed. All this means is that the channel has been scheduled to be
 * closed. The underlying raw channel may not yet be closed. The underlying channel has been closed if the close
 * future has been completed.
 * </ol>
