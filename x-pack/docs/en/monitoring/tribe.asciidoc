=== Configuring a Tribe Node to Work with Monitoring

If you connect to a cluster through a <<modules-tribe,tribe node>>,
and you want to monitor the tribe node, then you will need to install {xpack} on
that node as well.

With this configuration, the tribe node is included in the node count displayed
in the Monitoring UI, but is not included in the node list because it does not
export any data to the monitoring cluster.

To include the tribe node in the monitoring data, enable Monitoring data
collection at the tribe level:

[source,yaml]
----------------------------------
node.name: my-tribe-node1

tribe:
  on_conflict: prefer_cluster1
  c1:
    cluster.name: cluster1
    discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts: [ "cluster1-node1:9300", "cluster1-node2:9300", "cluster1-node2:9300" ]
    xpack.monitoring.enabled: true <1>
  c2:
    cluster.name: cluster2
    discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts: [ "cluster2-node3:9300", "cluster2-node3:9300", "cluster2-node3:9300" ]
    xpack.monitoring: <2>
      enabled: true
      exporters:
        id1:
          type: http
          host: [ "monitoring-cluster:9200" ]
----------------------------------
<1> Enable data collection from the tribe node using a Local Exporter.
<2> Enable data collection from the tribe node using an HTTP Exporter.

When you enable data collection from the tribe node, it is included in both the
node count and node list.
