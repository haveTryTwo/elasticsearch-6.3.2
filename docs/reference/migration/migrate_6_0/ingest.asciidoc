=== Ingest changes

==== Timestamp meta-data field type has changed

The type of the "timestamp" meta-data field has changed from `java.lang.String` to `java.util.Date`.

==== The format of the string-formatted ingest.timestamp field has changed

Previously, since Elasticsearch 5.4.0, you needed to use `ingest.new_date_format` to have the
`ingest.timestamp` metadata field be formatted in such a way that ES can coerce it to a field
of type `date` without further transformation. This is not necessary anymore and this setting was
removed. You can now simply set a field to `{{ingest.timestamp}}` in a pipeline, and have that
field be of type `date` without any mapping errors.
