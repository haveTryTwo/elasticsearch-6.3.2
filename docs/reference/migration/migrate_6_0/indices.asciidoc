=== Indices changes

==== Index templates use `index_patterns` instead of `template`

Previously templates expressed the indices that they should match using a glob
style pattern in the `template` field. They should now use the `index_patterns`
field instead. As the name implies you can define multiple glob style patterns
in an array but for convenience defining a single pattern as a bare string is
also supported. So both of these examples are valid:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT _template/template_1
{
  "index_patterns": ["te*", "bar*"],
  "settings": {
    "number_of_shards": 1
  }
}
PUT _template/template_2
{
  "index_patterns": "te*",
  "settings": {
    "number_of_shards": 1
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE


==== Shadow Replicas have been removed

Shadow replicas don't see enough usage, and have been removed. This includes the
following settings:

- `index.shared_filesystem`
- `index.shadow_replicas`
- `node.add_lock_id_to_custom_path`

==== Open/Close index API allows wildcard expressions that match no indices by default

The default value of the `allow_no_indices` option for the Open/Close index API
has been changed from `false` to `true` so it is aligned with the behaviour of the
Delete index API. As a result, Open/Close index API don't return an error by
default when a provided wildcard expression doesn't match any closed/open index.

==== Delete a document

Delete a document from non-existing index has been modified to not create the index.
However if an external versioning is used the index will be created and the document
will be marked for deletion. 

==== Indices aliases api resolves indices expressions only against indices

The index parameter in the update-aliases, put-alias, and delete-alias APIs no
longer accepts alias names. Instead, it accepts only index names (or wildcards
which will expand to matching indices).

==== Delete index api resolves indices expressions only against indices

The index parameter in the delete index API no longer accepts alias names.
Instead, it accepts only index names (or wildcards which will expand to
matching indices).

==== Support for `+` has been removed in index expressions

Omitting the `+` has the same effect as specifying it, hence support for `+`
has been removed in index expressions.

==== Translog retention

Translog files are now kept for up to 12 hours (by default), with a maximum size of `512mb` (default), and
are no longer deleted on `flush`. This is to increase the chance of doing an operation based recovery when
bringing up replicas up to speed.

==== Limit to the difference between max_size and min_size in NGramTokenFilter and NGramTokenizer

To safeguard against creating too many index terms, the difference between
max_ngram and min_ngram in NGramTokenFilter and NGramTokenizer has been
limited to 1. This default limit can be changed with the index setting
index.max_ngram_diff. Note that if the limit is exceeded a deprecation
warning is logged.

==== Limit to the difference between max_size and min_size in ShingleTokenFilter

To safeguard against creating too many tokens, the difference between
max_shingle_size and min_shingle_size in ShingleTokenFilter has been
limited to 3. This default limit can be changed with the index setting
index.max_shingle_diff. Note that if the limit is exceeded a deprecation
warning will be logged.
