=== Stats and info changes

==== Removal of `throttle_time` in the `store` stats

Given that store throttling has been removed, the `store` stats do not report
`throttle_time` anymore.

==== FS stats no longer reports if the disk spins

Elasticsearch has defaulted to assuming that it is running on SSDs since
the 2.x series of Elasticsearch. As such, Elasticsearch no longer needs to
collect information from the operating system as to whether or not the
underlying disks of each data path spin or not. While this functionality was no
longer needed starting in the 2.x series of Elasticsearch, it was maintained in
the filesystem section of the nodes stats APIs. This information has now been
removed.
