=== Cluster changes

==== Cluster name no longer allowed in path.data

Previously the cluster name could be used in the `path.data` setting with a
warning. This is now no longer allowed. For instance, in the previous version
this was valid:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------
# Assuming path.data is /tmp/mydata
# No longer supported:
$ tree /tmp/mydata
/tmp/mydata
├── <cluster_name>
│   └── nodes
│       └── 0
│           └── <etc>

# Should be changed to:
$ tree /tmp/mydata
/tmp/mydata
├── nodes
│   └── 0
│       └── <etc>
--------------------------------------------------
