==== Java High Level REST Client

Starting from version 5.6.0 a new Java client has been released: the Java High Level REST Client.
This official high-level client (named like this to differentiate it from the existing low-level client) for
Elasticsearch can be used to execute search, index, delete, update and bulk operations using the same Core
Java classes as the `TransportClient` uses.

This Java High Level REST Client is designed to replace the `TransportClient` in a near future.
