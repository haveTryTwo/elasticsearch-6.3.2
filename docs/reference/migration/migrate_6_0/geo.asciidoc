=== Geo changes

==== Deprecated `ShapeBuilders` helper class

The `ShapeBuilders` class containing static methods to create shape specific builders
(e.g., `ShapeBuilders.newPoint`) has been deprecated. One must now use the builder's
constructor instead (e.g., `new MultiPointBuilder()).

==== Deprecated `ShapeBuilder.parse` static method

The `ShapeBuilder.parse` method has been deprecated. Use `ShapeParser.parse` instead.
