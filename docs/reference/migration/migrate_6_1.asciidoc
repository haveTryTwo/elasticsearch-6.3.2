=== Bootstrap checks now apply to link-local addresses

Previously when Elasticsearch was bound to localhost, Elasticsearch would bind
to any address on the loopback device. This included link-local addresses on the
loopback device such as `fe80::1%lo0` on macOS. Starting in 6.1.2, Elasticsearch
will now only bind to loopback addresses on the loopback device. Because of the
previous behavior, Elasticsearch would skip the bootstrap checks if bound to a
link-local address. Now that Elasticsearch no longer binds to such addresses
when binding to localhost, the bootstrap checks now apply to link-local
addresses.
