== Breaking changes in 6.0

This section discusses the changes that you need to be aware of when migrating
your application to Elasticsearch 6.0.

[float]
=== Indices created before 6.0

Elasticsearch 6.0 can read indices created in version 5.0 or above.  An
Elasticsearch 6.0 node will not start in the presence of indices created in a
version of Elasticsearch before 5.0.

[IMPORTANT]
.Reindex indices from Elasticsearch 2.x or before
=========================================

Indices created in Elasticsearch 2.x or before will need to be reindexed with
Elasticsearch 5.x in order to be readable by Elasticsearch 6.x.

=========================================

[IMPORTANT]
.Multiple mapping types are not supported in indices created in 6.0
=========================================

The ability to have multiple mapping types per index has been removed in 6.0.
New indices will be restricted to a single type. This is the first step in the
plan to remove mapping types altogether.  Indices created in 5.x will continue
to support multiple mapping types.

See <<removal-of-types>> for more information.

=========================================
