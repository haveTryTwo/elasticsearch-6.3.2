.Known issue with Elasticsearch 6.3.x on JDK 10
======================================================

There appears to be a bug in JDK 10 impacting Elasticsearch 6.3.x (note that the
official Docker images are based on JDK 10). The issue appears to impact the C2
compiler on hardware that supports
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVX-512[AVX-512 instructions] (e.g., Skylake-X
CPUs). The issue manifests as a segmentation fault in Java code executing
`org.apache.lucene.util.MergedIterator#pullTop`:

A workaround is to disable the C2 compiler from using AVX-512 instructions via
the <<jvm-options,JVM option>> `-XX:UseAVX=2`. This issue has been taken
upstream to the JDK maintainers and the workaround will be necessary until a
version of the JDK that is not prone to this issue is released. For additional
background, see {issue}31425[#31425].

== {es} version 6.3.0

[IMPORTANT]
.Known issue upgrading from 5.x
======================================================

Upgrades from any 5.x version will fail for indexes which are prepared using the
<<indices-synced-flush, _synced flush API>>, or were automatically sync-flushed
due to inactivity. If upgrading from those versions, please wait for 6.3.1 to be
released.

Clusters with a Gold or Platinum license that are upgrading to 6.3 will need to
explicitly set `xpack.security.enabled: true` in `elasticsearch.yml` to upgrade
successfully.  If this value is not set, the cluster will be unable to form
after upgrade.
