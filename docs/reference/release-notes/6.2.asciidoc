Security::
* Added CachingRealm to published artifacts so it can be used in custom realm
extensions.
* If the realm uses native role mappings and the security index health changes,
the realm caches are cleared. For example, they are cleared when the index
recovers from a red state, when the index is deleted, when the index becomes
outdated, and when the index becomes up-to-date.
* Fixed a bug that could prevent auditing to a remote index if the remote
cluster was re-started at the same time as the audited cluster.
* Removed AuthorityKeyIdentifier's Issuer and Serial number from certificates
generated by `certgen` and `certutil`. This improves compatibility with
certificate verification in {kib}.

Watcher::
* Proxies now use HTTP by default, which was the default prior to 6.0. This
fixes issues with HTTPS requests that tried to access proxies via HTTP.
* Fixed the HTML sanitizer settings
(`xpack.notification.email.html.sanitization.*`), which were broken in 6.2. For
more information, see <<notification-settings>>.

Machine Learning::
* Increased tokenization flexibility for categorization. Now all {es} analyzer
functionality is available, which opens up the possibility of sensibly
categorizing non-English log messages. For more information, see {stack-ov}/ml-configuring-categories.html#ml-configuring-analyzer[Customizing the Categorization Analyzer].
* Improved the sensitivity of the analysis to high variance data with lots of
values near zero.
* Improved the decay rate of the model memory by using a weighted moving average.
* Machine learning indices created after upgrading to 6.2 have the
`auto_expand_replicas: 0-1` setting rather than a fixed setting of 1 replica.
As a result, {ml} indices created after upgrading to 6.2 can have a green
status on single node clusters. There is no impact in multi-node clusters.
* Changed the credentials that are used by {dfeeds}. When {security} is enabled,
a {dfeed} stores the roles of the user who created or updated the {dfeed}
**at that time**. This means that if those roles are updated, the {dfeed}
subsequently runs with the new permissions that are associated with the roles.
However, if the user's roles are adjusted after creating or updating the {dfeed}
then the {dfeed} continues to run with the permissions that are associated with
the original roles. For more information, see
{stack-ov}/ml-dfeeds.html[Datafeeds].
* Added a new `scheduled` forecast status, which indicates that the forecast
has not started yet.

* Allow `_doc` as a type. {pull}27816[#27816] (issues: {issue}27750[#27750], {issue}27751[#27751])

Monitoring::
* {monitoring} indices (`.monitoring`) created after upgrading to 6.2 have the
`auto_expand_replicas: 0-1` setting rather than a fixed setting of 1 replica.
As a result, monitoring indices created after upgrading to 6.2 can have a green
status on single node clusters. There is no impact in multi-node clusters.
* Added a cluster alert that triggers whenever a node is added, removed, or
restarted.

Security::
* Added the ability to refresh tokens that were created by the token API. The
API provides information about a refresh token, which you can use within 24
hours of its creation to extend the life of a token. For more information, see
<<security-api-tokens>>.
* Added principal and role information to `access_granted`, `access_denied`,
`run_as_granted`, and `run_as_denied` audit events. For more information about
these events, see {stack-ov}/auditing.html[Auditing Security Events].
* Added audit event ignore policies, which are a way to tune the verbosity of an
audit trail. These policies define rules for ignoring audit events that match
specific attribute values. For more information, see
{stack-ov}/audit-log-output.html#audit-log-ignore-policy[Logfile Audit Events Ignore Policies].
* Added a certificates API, which enables you to retrieve information about the
X.509 certificates that are used to encrypt communications in your {es} cluster.
For more information, see <<security-api-ssl>>.

* Adjust CombinedDeletionPolicy for multiple commits {pull}27456[#27456] (issues: {issue}10708[#10708], {issue}27367[#27367])
* Keeps index commits up to the current global checkpoint {pull}27367[#27367] (issue: {issue}10708[#10708])

Snapshot/Restore::
* Use AmazonS3.doesObjectExist() method in S3BlobContainer {pull}27723[#27723]
* Remove XContentType auto detection in BlobStoreRepository {pull}27480[#27480]
* Include include_global_state in Snapshot status API (#22423) {pull}26853[#26853] (issue: {issue}22423[#22423])

Task Manager::
* Add ability to associate an ID with tasks  {pull}27764[#27764] (issue: {issue}23250[#23250])

Translog::

Watcher::
* Added the ability to set the `index` and `doc_type` dynamically in an index
action. For more information, see {stack-ov}/actions-index.html[Index Action].
* Added a `refresh` index action attribute, which enables you to set the
refresh policy of the write request. For more information, see
{stack-ov}/actions-index.html[Index Action].
* Added support for actions in slack attachments, which enables you to add
buttons that can be clicked in slack messages. For more information, see
{stack-ov}/actions-slack.html[Slack Action].
* {watcher} indices (`.watch*` and `triggered_watches`) created after upgrading
to 6.2 have the `auto_expand_replicas: 0-1` setting rather than a fixed setting
of 1 replica. As a result, {watcher} indices created after upgrading to 6.2 can
have a green status on single node clusters. There is no impact in multi-node
clusters.

for model plots. This inconsistency resulted in problems plotting these buckets
in {kib}.
