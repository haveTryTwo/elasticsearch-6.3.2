* Reduced the sensitivity of the analysis to small perturbations in the input
data.
* Disabled the ability to create forecasts for jobs that were created before
6.1.0.

particular, the problem occurred when the number of processors on the transport

{stack-ov}/ssl-tls.html[Setting up TLS on a Cluster].

* Improve shard-failed log messages. {pull}26866[#26866]

Machine Learning::
* Improved the way {ml} jobs are allocated to nodes, such that it is primarily
determined by the estimated memory requirement of the job. If there is insufficient
information about the job's memory requirements, the allocation decision is based
on job counts per node.
* Increased the default value of the `xpack.ml.max_open_jobs` setting from `10`
to `20`. The allocation of jobs to nodes now considers memory usage as well as
job counts, so it's reasonable to permit more small jobs on a single node. For
more information, see <<ml-settings>>.
* Decreased the default `model_memory_limit` property value to 1 GB for new jobs.
If you want to create a job that analyzes high cardinality fields, you can
increase this property value. For more information, see <<ml-apilimits>>.
* Improved analytics related to decay rates when predictions are very accurate.
* Improved analytics related to detecting non-negative quantities and using this
information to constrain analysis, predictions, and confidence intervals.
* Improved periodic trough or spike detection.
* Improved the speed of the aggregation of {ml} results.
* Improved probability calculation performance.
* Expedited bucket processing time in very large populations by determining when
there are nearly duplicate values in a bucket and de-duplicating the samples that
are added to the model.
* Improved handling of periodically missing values.
* Improved analytics related to diurnal periodicity.
* Reduced memory usage during population analysis by releasing redundant memory
after the bucket results are written.
* Improved modeling of long periodic components, particularly when there is a
long bucket span.

Mapping::
* Allow ip_range to accept CIDR notation {pull}27192[#27192] (issue: {issue}26260[#26260])
